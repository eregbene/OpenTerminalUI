# BSI V3 Planned-Entry Hardening Audit

Source: `data\research\bsi_v3_planned_entry_jan_aug_2026.json`

Status: `PARTIAL_HARDENING_AUDIT_FROM_EXISTING_COMPACT_ARTIFACT`

Important limitation: the compact Jan-Aug artifact stores full aggregate totals but not every timestamped planned trade row. Exact dedup, latency, same-bar, portfolio sequencing, and adaptive attribution need an instrumented replay artifact.

Docker verification from live checks: backend image `bensim-trading:latest` is healthy; fast watcher env loaded; watcher startup log observed; no real-money deployment requested or performed.
